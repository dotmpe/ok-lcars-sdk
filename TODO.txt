(A) 2018-08-06 1: Look at more complex elbow layouts, but after TODO-2 I guess. Also build a thick horizontal, thin vertical variant like used on many control surfaces (form 4 / layout 2.1) <var/ok-sdk/content/forms>
(B) 2018-09-29 7: Wrap documentation/app at Sitefile into LCARS style as well. Some tweaks needed to Sitefile hnav client-component.
(B) 2018-09-29 8: Documentation for CSS classes and usage; layout principles, Sass, adaptive pages, etc. @docs
(C) 2018-09-29 9: Styling should be more confined to specific elements, not change page's html/body/div... @bugs ie. check archive.is, web.archive.org. Solve with [TODO-2].
(C) 2018-08-06 2: Rewrite to Sass, add adaptive classes. [TODO-8] First get some documentation system going
(C) 2022-02-17 16: Introduce new @Sass class for blocks/pills. 
(D) 2018-08-06 4: Build reusable components, based on Sass/script, maybe see about webelements at some point

(E) 2020-11-27 13: Get latest (4.0.0) SDK version working with Sitefile, have another look at JS API

(F) 2018-09-29 6: Cannot run repo with sitefile directly <run.sh> setup submodules for non-dev @bugs @DevOps <.gitmodules>
(F) 2019-04-23 12: Merge YAML-OK metadata (style/nav etc) with templates. Initial work done, better custom Sf context would help.
